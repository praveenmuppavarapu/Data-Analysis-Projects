# Praveen Store Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I have cleaned and analyzed sales data from Praveen Store, using Excel to create pivot charts that answer key business questions. The project includes the following components:

- **Data Cleaning:** Preparation and cleansing of raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Representation:** Visualization of the cleaned data using pivot charts to answer questions such as:
  - What are the top five states with the most sales?
  - Which distribution channels are most effectively contributing to sales?
  - Other relevant sales insights.

To enhance usability, I have also added slicers for Channel, Categories, and Month, allowing for easy filtering and deeper inspection of the data.

## Key Features

- **Top Sales States:** Identification of the top five states with the highest sales figures.
- **Effective Distribution Channels:** Analysis of which distribution channels are driving the most sales.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Slicers for Channel, Categories, and Month to facilitate dynamic data exploration and visualization.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of Praveen Store's sales performance, enabling better decision-making through data-driven insights.
