# Customer Success Dashboard

## Project Overview

In this project, I have created a Customer Success Dashboard using e-commerce datasets. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of the business, enabling data-driven decision-making. The project includes the following components:

- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Visualization of sales trends over the years.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Analysis and representation of customer satisfaction metrics.
- **Delivery Status:** Evaluation of delivery performance, including the percentage of on-time deliveries and the percentage of returns.
- **Customer Acquisition Analysis:** Analysis of customer acquisition through different modes, including Ads, Organic, and Returning customers.

To enhance usability, I have also added slicers and filters for Year, Product Name, State, and Acquisition Type, allowing for easy filtering and deeper inspection of the data.

## Key Features

- **Sales Trend Over the Years:** Graphical representation of sales performance over multiple years.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Metrics and visualizations depicting customer satisfaction levels.
- **Delivery Status:** Statistics on delivery performance, focusing on on-time deliveries and return rates.
- **Customer Acquisition:** Insights into customer acquisition channels, such as Ads, Organic, and Returning customers.
- **Interactive Slicers and Filters:** Slicers and filters for Year, Product Name, State, and Acquisition Type to facilitate dynamic data exploration and visualization.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of customer success metrics, enabling better decision-making through data-driven insights.
