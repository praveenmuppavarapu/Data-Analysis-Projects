# Hotel Booking Summary
## Customer Requirement:
The customer provided a hotel dataset containing information for both Resort and City hotels spanning the years 2015 to 2017. The primary interest was to extract insights from the year 2016 specifically for the Resort hotel during the summer months of July and August. Additionally, the customer sought insights for other months as well. The focus areas included analyzing cancellation levels, average daily rates, and monthly revenue comparisons between revenue generated and revenue lost.

## Approach:
I conducted a comprehensive analysis using Power BI, resulting in the creation of two distinct dashboards.

## Dashboard 1 - Business Summary Insights - 2016
This dashboard provides a summary of the business activity in the year 2016, with a primary emphasis on understanding the factors contributing to cancellations. Key observations include:

#### Seasonal Revenue Trends: 
Noted a significant increase in both revenue and revenue losses during the summer months of July and August.

#### Favorable Average Daily Rate: 
Identified that the average daily rate was notably higher in July and August, which is a positive indicator.

#### Cancellation Patterns: 
Found that cancellation rates were particularly high in the months of February, April, June, and October.

#### Day-wise Cancellations: 
Revealed that Thursdays and Fridays experienced higher cancellation rates compared to other days of the week.

#### Lead Time Impact: 
Bookings with lead times exceeding one month were more susceptible to cancellations.

## Key Recommendations:

#### Optimize Average Daily Rate: 
Lowering the average daily rate might help mitigate the number of cancellations.

#### Target Long Lead Times: 
Efforts should be directed towards managing and incentivizing bookings with lead times exceeding one month.

## Dashboard 2 - Comprehensive Business Overview:

This dashboard offers a holistic view of the entire business, enabling year-wise filtering. It includes detailed tables summarizing revenue trends over time and presenting percentage changes compared to the previous year. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards present annual-level insights into revenue, losses, and cancellation rates, providing a broader understanding of the business's performance.

Incorporating these two dashboards delivers a robust data-driven perspective on the hotel's operations, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
